Organization of this Book
=========================

This book is organized by parts.  The first part of the book is
material that most Modelica users should be familiar with.  It
includes the basics about variables, equations, components and
architectures.  The order of topics in the first part is important
since each successive chapter builds on the previous.

Beyond the basics that most Modelica users will be interested in,
there are two additional parts.  The second part of the book focuses
on how to create libraries of components.  The last part of the book
covers a series of advanced topics.  Each chapter in the last part
stands on its own as an interesting exploration of the chapter topic.
