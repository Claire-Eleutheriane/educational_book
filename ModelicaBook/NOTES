Sphinx Cheatsheet
=================

Sections

I plan to use the following order for characters for book structure:

  * `*` - Chapters
  * `=` - Sections
  * `-` - Subsections
  * `^' - Subsubsections

Sidebars
--------

.. sidebar:: title

   content

"Asides"

I figured out a nice LaTeX style for asides, etc.  Use the notice class in LaTeX and make the
enclosed sub-section unnumbered.  So something like this:

\begin{notice}{caution}{}
\subsection*{Aside on States}

...

\end{notice}

I hacked this together by hand, so it would need to be added to the LaTeX handling.

On the HTML side, it is simple enough to give the aside a reference by preceeding the
section with a label and then adding the label to the "addclass_id_map" and give it
a different appearence in the HTML (by assigning a new class to it).  For Bootstrap,
this looks like:

# equations.rst

.. _aside-on-states:

Aside on States
===============

# conf.py

addclass_id_map = {
    "aside-on-states": ["alert", "alert-info"]
}
