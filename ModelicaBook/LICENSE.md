While I prefer that people use the HTML version hosted at http://mbe.modelica.university,
I don't want to restrict the book to purely online uses (hence the CC license

I **welcome** pull requests. Pull requests make it very easy for me to incorporate
changes and greatly improve the chances that your contribution will be accepted.
But, if you submit a pull request I'll need you to
sign a contributor agreement that signs the copyright over to me. This is not
an attempt to take credit for work done by contributors, it is merely a way to
avoid any legal complications. If you make such contributions I will gladly
acknowledge them in the book.

People should feel free to fork the distribution for the purpose of making pull requests.
But a license is NOT granted for redistribution of the source code or derived works.
If you'd like to improve the book, please submit a pull request and I will gladly
incorporate your changes into the next release of the book. What I don't want is
lots of slightly different versions of the book floating around. These restrictions
are meant to make sure contributions are consolidated back into the book.
