    "Two ThermoSysPro components model a centrifugal pump: [StaticCentrifugalPump](https://thermosyspro.gitlab.io/documentation/src/WaterSteam/Machines/StaticCentrifugalPump.html) and [CentrifugalPump](https://thermosyspro.gitlab.io/documentation/src/WaterSteam/Machines/CentrifugalPump.html).\n",

    "CentrifugalPump is a very general pump model, which enables all functioning modes except for cavitation.\n",
    "This component covers all functioning modes in static as well as in dynamic.\n",
    "In practice, we need the characteristic on the four quadrants which are rarely given by the pump constructors.\n",

    "StaticCentrifugalPump can be seen as a static restriction of CentrifugalPump to the first quadrant, corresponding to \"Normal pumping\".\n",
    "This component must be used only in normal functioning, even only in nominal functioning as dynamic aspects are neglected.\n",

    "StaticCentrifugalPump thus corresponds to CentrifugalPump with:\n",
    "- static equations (derived terms are removed),\n",
