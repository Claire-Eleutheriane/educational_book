# ThermoSysPro educational book

This educational book is based on the book ["Modeling and Simulation of Thermal Power Plants using ThermoSysPro"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783030051044) written by the main developers of the ThermoSysPro library, Daniel Bouskela and Baligh El Hefni.

[EDF](https://www.edf.fr/) and [Phimeca Engineering](https://www.phimeca.com/) allied their strength to develop this online book. The purpose is to learn to use ThermoSysPro through examples and use cases. The statistical analysis of ThermoSysPro models is made by Phimeca using [Python](https://www.python.org/) language.  

More information about the library can be found on ThermoSysPro [website](https://thermosyspro.com/), [documentation](https://thermosyspro.gitlab.io/documentation/) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/ThermoSysPro/ThermoSysPro).
